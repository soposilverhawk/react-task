## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the form layout properly with all inputs and submit and reset buttons
- Input information into the input fields, check the checkboxes and radio buttons.
- Select multiple choices where there are checkbox options
- Select only one stooge (radio buttons)
- Submit the form
- Receive their submitted data in a visually JSON-like format
- Reset their submitted information with updated UI display

## My process

### Built with

- React - component-based UI library for building interfaces
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Javascript (ES6+) - Logic and interactivity
- Vite - Fast build tool and dev server


### What I learned

During this project I learned how to:

- Split the UI into reusable, modular components
- Pass information from parent to child components via props
- Work with states (updating, managing multiple states)
- Pass state, state setter functions and other functions as props
- Implement conditional rendering
- Manage reference-type state (like objects and arrays) using the spread operator
- Dynamically render elements using array.map
- Handling different inputs of same type with one function using event object and its properties
- Working with synthetic events
- Connect form input data to the state data
- Format data into a JSON-type format

### Continued development

Moving forward I plan to:

- Deepen my understanding of managing more complex state structures, such as nested objects and arrays
- Practice using the useEffect hook to handle side effects and lifecycle events in functional components
- Improve my ability to decide when to use multiple separate states versus a single, combined object within a component


### Useful resources

- [React.dev](https://react.dev/learn) - This helped me to understand how state works and how to implement it into my projects. It also helped me touch on the topic of controlled and uncontrolled components and sharing state between components. I really liked the react dev documentation in general as it often provides coherent explanations and guidelines regarding all topics related to react
